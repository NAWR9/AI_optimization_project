Project Instance format
-------------------

There are 2 files represent two problem instances:
* Sparse82 - an instance with n = 80
* RanReal240 - 20 RanReal instances with n = 240

The format of the files is:

The first line has the following fields separated with spaces:
* M: Integer indicating the number of elements
* C: Integer indicating the number of clusters
* Cluster limits: Lower and upper limits of each cluster
* Centinel: Letter "W", it has no sense, it is used only as separator
* Node weights: The weight of each node

The following lines contain the edges weight (which represent for example distance between elements) with
the format: elementA elementB edge_weight
